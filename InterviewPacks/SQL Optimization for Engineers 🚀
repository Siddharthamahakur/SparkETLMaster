🔄 Before and After SQL Optimization
❌ Unoptimized SQL Code
SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE order_date >= '2024-01-01' AND order_status = 'Completed';
Issues:

🟥 **SELECT ***: Fetches unnecessary data, increasing query load.
🟥 No Indexing: Can lead to full table scans.
🟥 Static Date Filtering: Not flexible for automation.
✅ Optimized SQL Code
SELECT order_id, customer_id, total_amount
FROM Orders
WHERE order_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '90' DAY
AND order_status = 'Completed';
Improvements:
🎯 Only Required Columns → Reduces data transfer.
⚡ Uses Indexed Columns (order_date, order_status).
🔄 Dynamic Date Filtering → Allows automated execution.
🚀 Top SQL Performance Optimization Techniques
1️⃣ Use Indexing for Faster Queries 📌

CREATE INDEX idx_orders_date_status ON Orders(order_date, order_status);
✅ Boosts filtering speed by allowing indexed lookups.

2️⃣ Avoid SELECT * – Fetch Only Required Columns 🎯
SELECT order_id, customer_id FROM Orders WHERE order_status = 'Completed';
✅ Reduces memory usage and improves query performance.

3️⃣ Use Joins Instead of Subqueries 🔄
SELECT o.order_id, c.customer_name
FROM Orders o
JOIN Customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id;
✅ Joins are faster than correlated subqueries.

4️⃣ Use Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for Readability & Performance 📊
WITH recent_orders AS (
    SELECT order_id, customer_id FROM Orders WHERE order_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30' DAY
)
SELECT * FROM recent_orders;
✅ Helps organize complex queries and improves performance.

5️⃣ Optimize Duplicate Handling (De-Duplication) ✅
DELETE FROM Customers
WHERE id NOT IN (
    SELECT MIN(id) FROM Customers GROUP BY email
);
✅ Efficient way to remove duplicates using GROUP BY.

🔥 Latest SQL Interview FAQs & Advanced Questions
Q1: How do you optimize SQL queries for big data tables?
✅ Partitioning, Indexing, Proper Joins, and Avoiding Full Table Scans.

Q2: How do you efficiently delete duplicate records?
✅ Use ROW_NUMBER() OVER() or DISTINCT ON to identify and remove duplicates.

Q3: Difference between INNER JOIN vs LEFT JOIN?
INNER JOIN → Returns only matching records.
LEFT JOIN → Returns all left table records, even if no match in right table.
Q4: How do you implement SQL caching in Data Pipelines?
✅ Use Materialized Views or Redis for frequently accessed data.

💡 Final Thoughts
✅ SQL Optimization = Faster Queries + Efficient Data Handling 🚀
⚡ Master Indexing, Partitioning, and Query Structuring!
